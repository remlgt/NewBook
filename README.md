# NewBook

A new book to try news possibilities and features with CSS3 & JS & Bulma & Bootstrap.
In the goal to discover & trying some things and to upgrade my front level, I used a
model to build this new book, the model was made by a friend on photoshop and I try to
build the site based on his mode.

This app will be build with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, BootStrap, and other library like 
FontAwesome. For this book I did not integrate template or piece of code I write & try 
every features to get used to the basics of HTML / CSS / JS.
